The lowest eigenvalue then corresponds to the ground state\nenergy. Numerically, we can generate the Hamiltonian matrix and find\nthe eigenvalue for any value of $g$, effectively giving us the ground\nstate energy as a function of the strength of the interaction. We will\nrefer to that energy as the *exact* energy of the system. \n\nFrom our results, we now see some important differences between FCI\nand CI. Full configuration interaction is an exact method, but is only\npossible if and only if we have a complete and finite SD basis for our\nsystem. In practice, we usually don\'t have this. Non-complete\nCI however, is always possible, but gives the only  approximative\nresults. The method is variational however, so we are always\nguaranteed that the approximation will be equal or bigger to the true\nresult. \nPerturbation theory however, is non-variational and there is no guarantee that including higher orders in the \nperturbation gives an improved result, as we will see below.\n\nIn an FCI case, we are including all possible exictations to infinite\norder, meaning we have all possible 1p1h SDs, all possible 2p2h SDs\nand so on. In the CI case, we truncate those excitations somewhere. In\nour example we limited the excitations to at most 2p2h. We still got\nthe contribution from those 2p2h excitation to infinite order. If we\nwere to draw the diagrams of the interactions that contribute to this\nCI case, there would be an infinite number of them, as we can have\narbitrarily long chains of operators that still only have at most 2p2h\nintermediate states.',

             'solution': 'We now turn to MBPT to the fourth order. We now get a lot of diagrams\nthat can contribute to the energy, so we limit our discussion to the\ncanonical HF-case only. All of the diagrams in the canonical case are\nshown in figures 3, 4, 5 and 6 above. In our case howeber, due the\nnature of the pairign Hamiltonian, only few of these diagrams give\nnon-zero contributions. Using also the linked diagram theorem, where a\ndiagram is called unlinked if and only if it has a disconnected part\nthat is closed, we can eliminate some of the diagrams. Goldstones\nlinked-diagram theorem states that all unliked diagrams will cancel\nagains the renormalization terms in RSPT, meaning that we can define\nthe energy and wave function in each order as a sum of linked diagrams\nonly. We can then disregard diagram 33 and 41.\n\nLet us now go through all the diagrams and find those that vanish due\nto having broken pairs, i.e., the diagrams that vanish due to our\nspecific interaction. Take for example diagram 1, which vanishes due\nto having a term $\\langle ab\\vert \\hat{v} \\vert ci\\rangle$. From this\nargument, we see that all four diagrams from figure 3 vanish. Similar\narguments shows that most diagrams in figure 4 also dissapear. Going\nthrough all the diagrams, we see that 5, 6, 14 and 15 are the ones\nthat do not vanish for figure 4. For figure 5 we actually see that all\ndiagrams vanish again. For figure 6 we already found that 33 and 41\nvanished due to being unlinked---the rest contribute to the\nperturbation.\n\nAll diagrams for figure 3 and 5 vanished for our interaction, this is\ndefinitly not a surprise, as those figures correspond to 1p1h and 3p3h\nexcitations respectively. As our reference state already has the four\nparticles positioned in two pairs, it goes without saying that and odd\nnumber of particle excitations requires broken pairs and will\nvanish. The same argument also explained why there were no diagrams\nthat vanished for figure 6. That figure shows the four-particle-four\nhole excited states, but as we only have four particles in our system,\nexciting all the particles will keep them collected in pairs, so we\nget no ubroken pairs. For the diagrams in figure 4 however, we have\n2p2h excitations. The diagrams that vanish correspond to the cases\nwhere we excite one particle from either pair, or excite both\nparticles in one pair, but into different levels, leaving us with a\nbroken pair.\n\nThe expressions for these diagrams can easily be written in terms of a\nsimple Python program. Note however that for every diagram we do\nactually perform loops over every single-particle state. As we will\nsee later this is extremely inefficient from a computational point\nview. In our discussions of the projects below, we will rewrite the\ncomputations of most diagrams in terms of efficient matrix-matrix\nmultiplications or matrix-vector multiplications.  The following\nPython program gives us the final results for perturbation to fourth\norder, where we also make a plot of the relative error in the\ncorrelation energy.

We also\nnote that the third-order is actually worse than the second order for\na strong interaction! This result illuminates the difference between\nperturbation theory and configuration interaction we noted earlier,\nincluding higher-order terms can possibly give a worse result\nfor perturbation theory. For CI however, including more excitations\nwill never give a worse result. We also see the consequences of\nperturbation theory not being a variational method, as both\napproximations undershoot the true ground state correlation energy of\nthe system.\n\nFrom the results, we note also that the fourth order MBPT approximation to\nthe correlation energy is better than the lower orders for $g<0$, but\nworse than the lower orders for $g>0$. Again this shows us an the\nimportant point of MBPT. There is no guarantee that the approximation\nwill converge to the exact solution as we increase the order. In fact,\nas we see in our case, increasing the order of the approximation might\nactually give you a worse result! Also, we see that MBPT is not\nvariational, so we can\'t simply calculate the approximation of many\ndifferent orders and choose the smallest one, as we then run the risk\nof undershooting the real ground state energy.',

In doing so you will find it convenient to write \nclasses which define the single-particle basis and the Hamiltonian. Your functions that solve the coupled cluster equations will then just need to set up variables which point to interaction elements and single-particle states with their pertinent quantum numbers. Use for example the setup discussed in the FCI lectures for the pairing model.',
