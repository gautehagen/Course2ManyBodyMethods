      "# Projects and how do develop a numerical project\n",
      "**July 6-24, Ganil, Caen, France**\n",
      "\n",
      "### Plan for the Talent course\n",
      "An essential element of the Talent courses is to develop a large project(s) which allows you to study and understand\n",
      "teoretical concepts in nuclear physics.  \n",
      "These concepts will in turn allow you to interpret results from experiments and understand the pertinent physics in terms of the underlying forces and laws of motion.\n",
      "\n",
      "Together with the regular lectures in the morning, the hope is that\n",
      "during these three weeks you will be able to write and run a program\n",
      "which implements at least one of the methods discussed during the\n",
      "lectures.  The lectures will also cover additional material which aims\n",
      "at giving you a broader view on what can be achieved with the methods\n",
      "to be discussed. Combined with the 'hands-on' afternoon sessions, the\n",
      "hope is that the lectures and the computational projects will together\n",
      "allow you to achieve these goals. For those of you who would like to\n",
      "get credits to be transferred to your home university, the project(s)\n",
      "can be extended upon allowing you to include further elements to the\n",
      "many-body methods. The load of the final project is estimated to be \n",
      "80 hours. In total, attendence at the course and doing\n",
      "the final project amounts to seven ECTS. There is no credit transfer\n",
      "for Northern-American students.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Outline of the project(s)\n",
      "\n",
      "What is outlined here are several paths that will allow you to develop\n",
      "a program which can be used to study nuclear systems. In particular,\n",
      "we will focus on two widely used many-body methods, coupled cluster\n",
      "theory with its various approximations and Green's function theory.\n",
      "\n",
      "Before we begin, we would however like to present a warm-up problem which \n",
      "contains\n",
      "many of the basic elements of the many-body methods exposed in this course. Furthermore, the simple pairing \n",
      "model described below, provides us with  benchmark results to which we can compare \n",
      "the different many-body methods. The basic elements of the model (single-particle basis and Hamiltonian)\n",
      "can easily be (if structured properly in your program) extended to studies of more realistic systems, either \n",
      "finite systems like nuclei or infinite nuclear matter. \n",
      "\n",
      "The first part of the project is a traditional paper and pencil part, where the aim is to \n",
      "apply second quantization in order to set up the Hamiltonian matrix to be diagonalized.\n",
      "We will study this model the first two afternoons of the school. \n",
      "\n",
      "At most, with four particles in four doubly degenerate single particle states and no broken pairs,\n",
      "you will have a $6 \\times 6$ Hamiltonian matrix to diagonalize. Below, you will find a simple python program\n",
      "which performs the diagonalization and plots the eigenvalues. Parts of this warm-up exercise are solved below. \n",
      "These aspects will be discussed partly during the lectures but also during some of the afternoon sessions.\n",
      "Practical guidelines for code writing will also be discussed.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "This exercise will allow us to start writing our first skeleton for a coupled cluster theory program at the so-called doubles level of truncation. It will also, for those of you who will prefer  to study Green's functions, serve as a \n",
      "starting point for developing the skeleton of a program for this method. The aim is to finish this part of the program during the first week.\n",
      "\n",
      "With a program which then benchmarks the simple pairing model, we will turn our attention to more realistic systems.\n",
      "Here we propose the following  paths that can be studied with either coupled cluster theory or Green's function theory. Many of the technicalities will be discussed at the lectures and the afternoon sessions during the last two weeks.\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Studies of nuclear matter with a cartesian basis using coupled cluster theory at the level of doubles excitations\n",
      "\n",
      "  * During the three weeks of the course we will mainly focus on two-particle and two-hole excitations \n",
      "\n",
      "  * Focusing only on two-particle correlations in a finite cartesian basis, these can be compared with Brueckner-Hartree-Fock calculations in the infinite limit. The latter should represent exactly two-particle correlations to infinite order. A simple model for the nuclear force will be used.\n",
      "\n",
      "  * For the final project the code can be extended to include particle-hole correlations as well\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Studies of finite nuclei using coupled cluster theory at the level of doubles excitations only\n",
      "\n",
      "  * Here we will provide Hartree-Fock based single-particle states and two-body interactions in an uncoupled scheme.\n",
      "\n",
      "  * The system to be studied is that of neutrons in harmonic oscillator traps. \n",
      "\n",
      "  * For the final project, one can include singles excitations as well.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "3. The two above paths can be performed using Green's function as well.\n",
      "\n",
      "  * Studies of infinite nuclear matter including two-particle and two-hole correlations using a cartesian basis.\n",
      "\n",
      "  * Comparison of two-particle correlations from Brueckner-Hartree-Fock calculations in the infinite limit\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Studies of finite nuclei with the Green's function method\n",
      "\n",
      "  * Again we will provide Hartree-Fock based single-particle states and two-body interactions in an uncoupled scheme.\n",
      "\n",
      "  * The system to be studied is that of neutrons in harmonic oscillator traps. \n",
      "\n",
      "  * For the final project, one can include self-consistently calculated single-particle energies as well.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "When working on the projects, we recommend strongly that you form teams of two-three participants. Every team\n",
      "**must** have a *github account* where we can monitor your progress and give you appropriate feedback.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you have not used version control before now, it is time to do so. \n",
      "Proper version control is central to a good ethical scientific conduct. \n",
      "We do require that you use some kind of version control software when working on the projects. We recommend strongly [github](https://github.com/). \n",
      "\n",
      "Furthermore, before coming to the course, we recommend that you refresh your knowledge on second quantization.\n",
      "If your background in second quantization is rudimentary and mentioning of Wick's leave you gazing at the stars,\n",
      "we recommend that you study the material at the course web site on [second quantization](http://nucleartalent.github.io/Course2ManyBodyMethods/doc/pub/secondquant/html/secondquant-bs.html). Try in particular to do some of the exercises.\n",
      "\n",
      "We will also require that you come with your own laptop and have installed either a\n",
      "* Fortran compiler or a \n",
      "\n",
      "* c++ compiler\n",
      "\n",
      "You can use Python as programming language as well, but normally the efficiency of Python for the problems addressed in this course is lower than for codes written in Fortran or c++. We recommend however that use Python as a scripting language for running codes and making plots, as well as using the ipython notebooks provided by us.  \n",

      "### Some basic ingredients for a successful numerical project\n",
      "\n",
      "In when building up a numerical project there are several elements you should think of\n",
      "  1. How to structure a code in terms of functions\n",
      "\n",
      "  2. How to make a module\n",
      "\n",
      "  3. How to read input data flexibly from the command line\n",
      "\n",
      "  4. How to create graphical/web user interfaces\n",
      "\n",
      "  5. How to write unit tests (test functions or doctests)\n",
      "\n",
      "  6. How to refactor code in terms of classes (instead of functions only), in our case you think of a system and a solver class\n",
      "\n",
      "  7. How to conduct and automate large-scale numerical experiments\n",
      "\n",
      "  8. How to write scientific reports in various formats (LaTeX, HTML)\n",
      "\n",
      "The conventions and techniques outlined here will save you a lot of time when you incrementally extend software over time from simpler to more complicated problems. In particular, you will benefit from many good habits:\n",
      "1. New code is added in a modular fashion to a library (modules)\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Programs are run through convenient user interfaces\n",
      "\n",
      "3. It takes one quick command to let all your code undergo heavy testing \n",
      "\n",
      "4. Tedious manual work with running programs is automated,\n",
      "\n",
      "5. Your scientific investigations are reproducible, scientific reports with top quality typesetting are produced both for paper and electronic devices.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "We present a simplified Hamiltonian consisting of an unperturbed\n",
      "Hamiltonian and a so-called pairing interaction term. It is a model\n",
      "which to a large extent mimicks some central features of atomic\n",
      "nuclei, certain atoms and systems which exhibit superfluiditity or\n",
      "superconductivity.  To study this system, we will use a mix of\n",
      "many-body perturbation theory (MBPT), Hartree-Fock (HF) theory and full\n",
      "configuration interaction (FCI) theory. The latter will also provide us with\n",
      "the exact answer.  When setting up the Hamiltonian matrix you will\n",
      "need to solve an eigenvalue problem.\n",
